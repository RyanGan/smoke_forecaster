HIA formula
delta_y = daily_baseline_rate x (1-e^-beta x delta_smk) x county pop at risk

Things I have:
- beta and population-weighted delta smk
- county pop at risk (easy enough to get and i'll need it for the rate)

Things I need:
- Daily ED rate for outcomes of interest; i can calculate this from the data I have from colorado, washington, and oregon.
